#CSS Only Parallax Boilerplate

*created by: Virsaviya Efraim*

Built using Keith Clark's [tutorial](http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/), this boilerplate is built to be responsive, automatically focusing on the center of the background while enabling parallax scrolling.

Play around with it to discover how it works.

To calculate the value of scale():  
    ( (-1 * translateZ)/perspective ) + 1
