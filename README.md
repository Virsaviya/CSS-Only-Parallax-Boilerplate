#CSS Only Parallax Boilerplate

*created by: Virsaviya Efraim*  
*updated on: January 12, 2016*

Built using Keith Clark's [tutorial](http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/) on parallax scroll and Jacob Gube's [tutorial](http://sixrevisions.com/css/responsive-background-image/) on responsive backgrounds.  

This boilerplate is built to be responsive, automatically focusing on the center of the background while enabling parallax scrolling.

Play around to discover how it works.
