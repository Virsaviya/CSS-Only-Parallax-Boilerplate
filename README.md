#CSS Only Parallax Boilerplate

*created by: Virsaviya Efraim*

Built using Keith Clark's [tutorial](http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/), this boilerplate is built to be responsive, automatically focusing on the center of the background while enabling parallax scrolling.

To calculate the scale:  
( (-1 * translateZ)/perspective ) + 1
